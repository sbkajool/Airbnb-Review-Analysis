# Airbnb Review Analysis

The objective of this project is to develop a deep knowledge of Airbnb guests' perspectives and experiences. We want to determine the top 20 keywords for each neighborhood, rating group, and sentiment score by looking at customer feedback and reviews using Regular Expression (Regex) package. We will be able to determine the words and phrases that appear most frequently in guest reviews using this method, and we will gain insight into the most typical themes and experiences shared by Airbnb guests. Understanding the elements that have the greatest impact on guest satisfaction will help Airbnb hosts improve the user experience, which may lead to more bookings, better ratings, and a better reputation. Also, by looking at the top keywords for each neighborhood, we can get more insights into the unique features and characteristics of various locations/neighborhoods, which can help hosts customize their amenities to suit the tastes of possible guests.
